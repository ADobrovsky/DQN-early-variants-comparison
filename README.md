# DQN-early-variants-comparison

Artefacts and results of an 1-week project within a machine learning course.

The project aimed to investigate some of the most important early improvements to DQN, i.e. those proposed shortly after the original DQN, in 2015 and 2016. As there are many improvements, the project could only focus on some selected ones, namely DQN with fixed target network, double DQN, dueling DQN, and soft instead of hard updates to the target network. This project aimed to explain the issues addressed by the improvements, the underlying theory, and to investigate their impact on performance and characteristics in several selfconducted experiments.
